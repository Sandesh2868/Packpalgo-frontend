## Issues Fixed

### 1. Group Storage Issue
**Problem**: Created groups were not being stored or saved properly.

**Fixes Applied**:
- Added debug logging to track group fetching
- Improved error handling in group creation
- Added refresh mechanism to ensure groups are loaded
- Added automatic refresh after group creation
- Enhanced user feedback with better success messages

**Testing Steps**:
1. Sign in to the application
2. Navigate to GoSplit section
3. Click "Create Group"
4. Fill in group details and create a group
5. Verify the group appears in the groups list
6. Check browser console for debug logs

### 2. UPI Payment Method Issue
**Problem**: UPI payment buttons were not functional.

**Fixes Applied**:
- Added click handlers to payment buttons
- Implemented payment processing function
- Added payment details display
- Created UPI link generation
- Added proper payment method handling

6. Check that UPI links are generated correctly

## Expected Behavior

### Group Creation
- Groups should be created and saved to Firebase
- Groups should appear in the groups list immediately
- Invite codes should be generated and displayed
- Error handling should work for network issues

### Payment Methods
- Payment buttons should be clickable
- Payment details should be displayed in an alert
- UPI links should be generated with proper format
- Different payment methods should show appropriate information

## Debug Information

The application now includes:
- Console logging for group fetching
- Better error messages for group creation
- Payment method debugging information
- Refresh functionality for groups list

## Notes

- This is a demo implementation
- Real payment integration would require actual payment gateway APIs
- UPI links are sample format and would need real UPI IDs
- Firebase security rules should be configured for production use
